# Coding challenge

## Cyber Ducks

Hi Ramon,
Thanks for the opportunity.
I had a great time coding!

[View Project](https://kcode100.github.io/Cyber-Ducks-Front-End-Assignment/)

### Goals

- To produce a website identical to the proofs provided
- To achieve a perfect lighthouse scoring whilst adhering to the design received

### Achievement

- Mobile first design
- Quotes slider
- Responsive navbar
- Scroll to top
- Toggle images
- CSS transitions & animations (aos library)
- hover/focus/active/select effects/custom scroll bar
- Perfect scoring (94% in accessibility due to background & foreground not having a sufficient contrast ratio - but I kept to the design instead)
